Fun with machine learning using the best dataset ever: Rogi, my doggie! 

In process of making the code public. 

A few fun "projects":
- Predict Rogi's GI status based on food intake
- Apple thinks Rogi is an Aussi, but he isn't! Can't blame Apple, most people don't guess he is a Siberian husky. Re-train some of the available networks to improve Rogi's classification accuracy.

More details on the Wiki page (being populated/updated over the next couple of weeks).
